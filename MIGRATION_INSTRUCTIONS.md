# Quick Migration Instructions

## Step 1: Export Your Data (2 minutes)

The export page should have opened in your browser. If not, double-click `export-localstorage.html`.

1. Click **"📥 Export All Data"** button
2. Click **"💾 Download JSON File"** button
3. The file `localstorage-export.json` will be downloaded
4. Move it to your project folder: `C:\Users\Epaminondas Pouris\Documents\AndecoShop\`

## Step 2: Run Migration

Once you have the file, I'll run the migration for you automatically!

Just let me know when the file is in your project folder.
